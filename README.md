# ParticleEmitterDemo-SK
This is a BETA implementation of our particle system in SpriteKit.

The biggest problem we have faced in porting our particle system to SpriteKit is the sheer lack of blending modes exposed by the framework.

What this means is that any effects created in Partilce Designer may look quite different when running inside SpriteKit.

Performance wise it seems to be on par with Apples own particle system, though we've not thoroughly tested this.


If anyone has any thoughts on how to get past the blending mode issue, we'd love to here from you.
